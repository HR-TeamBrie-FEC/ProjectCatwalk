## About this project<a name="about"></a>

**Description of the Project**

Our Front End Capstone project was designed to emulate real life development work in a team. We were responsible for creating our own tickets, planning for a set of 2-day sprints and reviewing each others code before the code is merged into the master branch


**Objectives**

Deliver a fully functional web application that meets the specifications and requirements outlined by project stakeholders. Work together on a single code base by dividing up the work among team members but working collaboratively to produce a single front end application. Integrate the front end with the existing API for the product, and demonstrate a working application at the end of the project timeline.

**Support**

Issues and Feedback can be reported through our GitHub Repository:
